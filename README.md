# machine-learning-image-classification
This machine learning task uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Three different machine learning algorithms will be used to observe their accuracy and relative-performance in this image classification problem. These algorithms are softmax regression, one-vs-rest logistic regression, and the gaussian naive Bayes classifier.
